# INFS3605 - Red Cross Pinpoint
Red Cross Pinpoint is a mobile application that aims to promote situational awareness of the Red Cross emblems’ unique and protective purpose. The development of Red Cross Pinpoint was inspired by the general lack of understanding of what the Red Cross emblems actually represent. Inappropriate misuses of the emblems — especially during peacetime — have ultimately diluted the protective power that the emblems possess and have severely diminished their effectiveness, importance and reputation in times of war. This app not only seeks to effectively educate users, but also ensure that they are protected and provided for during conflict(s). 

Features include:
* Sign-Up/Login/Profile
* Information - regarding Red Cross’ mission and their emblems
* Map - displays Red Cross stations with distances/lengths shown in real-time
* Navigation - turn-by-turn navigation for guidance to stations in unfamiliar areas
* Station Details - shows availability of resources such as food, medical assistance, blankets
* Find Family Member - users can add family members and request help when they become lost

## Prerequisites / Notes
A difference in emulators was found to affect the outlook of the UI, so we recommend downloading this emulator: Pixel 3a XL API29.

Since the emulator may not automatically know of your device’s current location, please set the location coordinates to [Latitude -33.909 ; Longitude 151.222] for demonstration purposes.

Upon signing in the first time, the emulator defaults to display somewhere within the USA map. Click on another section of the navigation bar (bottom) and then go back to the map. The emulator will reflect the location coordinates previously set (Kensington, Sydney).
